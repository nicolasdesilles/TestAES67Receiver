## Introduction

Welcome to the RAVENNAKIT reference documentation. RAVENNAKIT is a cross-platform Software Development Kit (SDK) for
integrating audio-over-IP technology into your applications. It supports widely adopted audio-over-IP protocols, 
including RAVENNA, AES67, and SMPTE ST 2110-30. Additionally, the SDK includes NMOS (IS-04 & IS-05) for device 
discovery and connection management, ST2022-7 for stream redundancy, and PTPv2 for time synchronization.

The SDK is written in C++17, and targets systems running macOS, Windows and Linux.

## Commercial Support & Licensing

The SDK is released under the AGPLv3 license. This ensures that the core remains open and that improvements can be
shared with the community. If AGPLv3 works for your project, you are free to use the SDK under its terms.

If you cannot or do not want to open source your product under AGPLv3 a commercial license is available. This license
allows you to:

- Use the SDK in proprietary products without the copyleft requirements of AGPLv3.
- Keep your application source code closed while still benefiting from the SDK.
- Optionally bundle the SDK as part of a larger commercial offering.

### Commercial Support

If you are integrating AES67 / RAVENNA / ST2110-30 into a product and want to reduce risk and time-to-market, we can
help with:

- Integration support. Guidance and hands-on help integrating the SDK into your existing architecture.
- Feature development & extensions. Development of new features, protocol extensions, or optimizations specific to your
  use case.
- Performance & reliability tuning. Profiling, troubleshooting, and improving latency, robustness, and scalability in
  real-world network conditions.
