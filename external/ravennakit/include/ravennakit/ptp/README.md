## PTP Port states (6.6.2.2)

### Master

The PTP Port is the source of time on the PTP Communication Path served by the PTP
Port.

### Slave

The PTP Port synchronizes to the PTP Port on the PTP Communication Path that is in the
MASTER state.

### Passive

The PTP Port is not the source of time on the PTP Communication Path nor does it
synchronize to a Master Clock.

## Oscillator frequency (7.2.2)

Oscillators used to establish or maintain the timescale of a PTP Instance (see 7.2.1) shall maintain a period,
that is, the inverse of the frequency, deviating no more than 0.01% from the period of a perfect oscillator of
the same nominal frequency.

## Epoch (7.2.3)

The PTP epoch (the epoch of timescale PTP) is 1 January 1970 00:00:00 TAI.
